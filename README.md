# Underactuated Tiltrotor Aircraft Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a capstone design project by a team of seven undergraduate students. The project aimed to create an underactuated tiltrotor aircraft inspired by the NEMO tiltrotor UAV. The aircraft is designed to achieve vertical takeoff and landing, horizontal cruising, and hovering capabilities through an innovative controller that eliminates the need for servo actuators and traditional tilt mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Unique Engine Design:** The aircraft features a distinctive engine design that replaces the Electronic Speed Controller and traditional tilt mechanisms with Pulsing firmware. This firmware is used to vector thrust from the propellers, contributing to the elimination of traditional components for long-range surveillance.

- **Efficiency Testing:** To ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the aircraft, a series of validation tests and analyses were conducted. These tests include the Angle Rotor Test, Thrust Test, and Tiltrotor test, all aimed at optimizing the design for superior performance.

- **Innovation in Aeronautical Design:** This project showcases the team's dedication to engineering innovation and efficiency in aeronautical design. Underactuated tiltrotors present a promising solution to the energy consumption and maneuverability challenges faced by traditional tiltrotors used in aerial robotics.

## Project Structure

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation related to the project, including design specifications, test results, and analysis reports.

- **Firmware:** The firmware directory holds the Pulsing firmware code responsible for vectoring thrust from the propellers and controlling the underactuated tiltrotor.

- **Tests:** Scripts and data from various validation tests conducted during the development process.


## Future Development

While the project represents a significant step towards underactuated tiltrotors, there is room for further development. The complex nature of underactuated-based systems, characterized by nonlinear dynamics and multi-objective optimization requirements, poses challenges that need to be addressed for scalability and advancement in the field of aerial robotics.

Contributions and collaborations are welcome to overcome these challenges and push the boundaries of underactuated tiltrotor technology.
